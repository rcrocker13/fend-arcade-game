===============================

In this Frogger like game you objective is simple.

Get to the water without colliding with any bugs.

To move this character across the tiles you will use the Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys.

If you are along the bottom, left or right most edge of the screen you will not be able to move any further in those direction. If your player comes in contact with a bug or the the water, at the far end, he will be placed back in the starting position.

Have fun and watch out for those bugs!
