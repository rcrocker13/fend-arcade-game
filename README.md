In this Frogger like game your objective is simple.

Move your player to the water on the far side of the screen without bumbing any bugs.

To move this character across the tiles you will use the Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys.

If you are along the bottom, left or right most edge of the screen you will not be able to move any further in those directions. If your player comes in contact with a bug or the the water, at the far end, he will be placed back in the starting position.

Have fun and watch out for those bugs!
